# CS4530_App1

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate code of a simple android app utilizing intent passing between two seperate activities.
This was originally a small project for a class, and now is being stored in a public repository to act as an example for both myself and
for other developers learning kotlin/android studio.

This app starts on a login screen that takes in a user's full name and a picture, then switches to a new activity that displays the name and picture.
